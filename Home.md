### Introduction
In this wiki you find pages with additional patterns for use in [Groundforge](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge/), made by [Jo Pol](https://github.com/d-bl). Given are the parameter-section and, in most cases, stitches, although not always traditional.

### Usage
All patterns are links to the Groundforge main page. Follow the link and click `SHOW` in the `DIAGRAM` section.  
Most of the patterns also have a scheme in the Groundforge gallery. Some, as the spiders and the larger fishes, don't. In the future there may be links to the gallery.

### Stitches
![pic-tct]Groundforge has rules as wich stitch-codes get what colour, according to the Belgian colour code. In this wiki, the pair-diagrams will not always show the Belgian colour code, due to the following, illustrated with an example. 
Suppose, you wish to work on the example above. The whole stitch & twist in the middle can be notated several way's. I prefer to code `ctc B1=tctct`, see [here][ex-tctct]. However, doing so, Groundforge colours this stitch in black in the pair-diagram (the left one). If you wish to see a red stitch, you have to code `ctc A2=ctcr B2=ctct`, see [here][ex-ctct].

### Pictures
The pictures in this wiki are mostly made in Knipling (TM).   
Most pair-diagrams are the styled versions that Groundforge understands. Red lines indicate the unit for the checkers-tiling, blue lines indicate the unit for the blocks tiling.

### Other links
[Groundforge user guide](https://github.com/d-bl/GroundForge/wiki)   
[Whiting Index](http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/jo/lace/whiting/index.htm#picindex): Jo Edkins created an annotated online index on the grounds in _A Lace Guide for Makers and Collectors_ by Gertrude Whiting which dates from 1920.     
[Groundforge Whiting Index](https://github.com/d-bl/GroundForge/wiki/Whiting-Index): The same index, with links to Groundforge scheme's and main page.

### Disclaimer
All links worked when created. Due to work on the Groundforge coding, there may be hiccups. There is a work-around, but I have to study this first. 

English is not my native language, so please forgive me any mistakes.
