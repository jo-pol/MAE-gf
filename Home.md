### Introduction
In this wiki you find pages with additional patterns for use in [Groundforge](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge/), made by [Jo Pol](https://github.com/d-bl). Given are the parameter-section and, in most cases, stitches, although not always traditional.

### Usage
All examples are links to the Groundforge main page. Follow the link and click `SHOW` in the `DIAGRAM` section. Please feel free to play with the stitches. E.g. try what happens if you change the default `ctc` of the spiders or fish in `ct`. If you wish to see the Groundforge scheme used in the example, click `PRICKING`.

Most of the patterns also have a scheme in the TesseLace index. Some, as the spiders and the larger fishes, don't. 

### Pictures
The pictures in this wiki are mostly made in Knipling (TM).   
Most pair-diagrams are the styled versions that Groundforge understands. Red lines indicate the unit for the checkers-tiling, blue lines indicate the unit for the blocks-tiling.

### Disclaimer
All links worked when created. Due to work on the Groundforge coding, there may be hiccups. There is a work-around, but I have to study this first.
