### Introduction
In this wiki you find pages with additional patterns for use in [Groundforge](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge/), made by [Jo Pol](https://github.com/d-bl). Given are the parameter-section and, in most cases, stitches. 

### Usage
All patterns are links to the Groundforge main page. Follow the link and click `SHOW` in the `DIAGRAM` section.

### Pictures
The pictures in this wiki are mostly made in Knipling (TM).   
Most pair-diagrams are the styled versions that Groundforge understands. Red lines indicate the unit for the checkers-tiling, blue lines indicate the unit for the blocks tiling.

### Other links
[Whiting Index](http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/jo/lace/whiting/index.htm#picindex): Jo Edkins created an annotated online index on the grounds in _A Lace Guide for Makers and Collectors_ by Gertrude Whiting which dates from 1920.

### Disclaimer
All links worked when created. Due to work on the Groundforge coding, there may be hiccups. There is a work-around, but I have to study this first. 

English is not my native language.
