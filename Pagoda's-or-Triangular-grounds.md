### Introduction

<img alt="pg unit" align="right" src="images_wt/gf-pg-unit.png">

In this article we show several placings of one unit of the _Pagoda_ or _Triangular_ ground. One unit is shown in 
the picture on the right.

Please note that some of the examples are mirrored. 




### Building Pagoda's

Bigger pagoda's can be build much in the same way as building bigger fish. 

The coloured dots indicate what goes where when translating the working scheme into a matrix. The black lines indicate one unit, the grey lines show where the other units connect.

The unit on the left looks more like the working-scheme. It works nice as a building block for the traditional pagoda, however, the matrix-scheme's for the other pagoda examples are harder to achieve. 






### Traditional pagoda's

Please note: traditionally the pagoda-ground uses a weaver, that returns round the pin with two twists at the pointy bit. The example looked better not turning.

### Bigger pagoda's

The resulting thread diagram shows a pagoda that is bended over, due to the chosen matrix-scheme.

(A self repeating scheme, nice.)

### Pagoda in a square

The units can be placed all facing in the same direction, or alternating.
