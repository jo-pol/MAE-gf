### Introduction
In this article we show several placings of one unit of the _Pagoda_ or _Triangular_ ground.   
The unit for the pagoda ground looks like the left in the picture below. The ground can be indicated very abstract with the image on the right. Please note, that some of the examples may be mirrored.

### Building Pagoda's
Bigger pagoda's can be build much in the same way as building bigger fish. 
The coloured dots indicate what goes where when translating the working scheme into a matrix. The black lines indicate one unit, the grey lines show where the other units connect.
