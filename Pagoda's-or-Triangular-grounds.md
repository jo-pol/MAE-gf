### Introduction
In this article we show several placings of one unit of the _Pagoda_ or _Triangular_ ground.   


### Building Pagoda's
Bigger pagoda's can be build much in the same way as building bigger fish. 
The coloured dots indicate what goes where when translating the working scheme into a matrix. The black lines indicate one unit, the grey lines show where the other units connect.
