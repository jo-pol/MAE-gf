### Introduction
<img align="right" alt="biasground" src="https://github.com/MAETempels/MAE-gf/blob/master/images_wt/gf%200221%20wt.png">

The traditional Bias Ground, or Ornamental Ground, is made as in the pair-diagram on the right. In this article we show different grounds based on this diagonal.<br>

Other nice grounds can be obtained by using one unit only. See [_Fancy examples_](https://github.com/MAETempels/MAE-gf/wiki/Fancy%20examples#short-bias).<br>
Better names for the examples will follow.

### Bias Ground with a diagonal in between
The Bias and the diagonal in between are connected diagonaly in the matrix-scheme. A horizontal connection also works.
