### Introduction
In this article some of my own designs and finds. Most grounds I found before I learned of Groundforge. Of course, some of them might also have been created by others.

### Lace lintje
![lees lintje][pic-ll]            
A few years ago I designed this small bookmark. The name is a pun upon the dutch word for "read" "lees", which is pronounced the same as "lace". "Lintje" means "ribbon".    
Clearly, this pattern as such can not be made with Groundforge, however, there is a near by. Please note: play only with the stitches of the rose-unit. The plaits, specified with `ctctctct`, should stay plaits.
