![pic-tct]Groundforge has rules as wich stitch-codes get what colour, according to the Belgian colour code. In this wiki, the pair-diagrams will not always show the Belgian colour code, due to the following, illustrated with an example. 
Suppose, you wish to work on the example above. The whole stitch & twist in the middle can be notated several way's. I prefer to code `ctc B1=tctct`, see [here][ex-tctct]. However, doing so, Groundforge colours this stitch in black in the pair-diagram (the left one). If you wish to see a red stitch, you have to code `ctc A1=ctcr A2=ctcr B2=ctct`, see [here][ex-ctct].

### Tiling
Most examples use the `brick` parameter setting, since it's less ID's to specify. Some scheme's do not have a working brick diagram, so, of course, a `checkers` parameter is used.    
Please note, that the ID's needed for the stitches shift somehow. A1 is not in the upperleft corner of the shown units in the examples.
