### Introduction
![pairdiagram][p-0221-wt]      
The traditional Bias Ground, or Ornamental Ground, is made as in above pair-diagram. In this article we show different grounds based on this diagonal.   
Some nice grounds can be   .    
Better names for the examples will follow.   

### Traditional Bias Ground

###  Bias Ground crossed rose style

> [WI D6][wi-D6], [WI F4][wi-F4]

### Bias Ground crossed differently

### Bias Ground with a row in between
The Bias and the row in between are connected diagonaly in the scheme. A horizontal connection also works.
