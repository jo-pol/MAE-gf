### Squared Snowflake
The little snowflake can also be put into a square. However, we have not been able (yet) to discover a working matrix-scheme for the crossed snowflake on the right. There is a matrix-scheme, but this is to big. See the article on the [Maths](https://github.com/MAETempels/MAE-gf/wiki/Mathematics#to-big-matrix) page.
