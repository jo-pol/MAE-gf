### Introduction
Lotus grounds are usualy used in small braids, 14-18 pairs.

### Lotus notation
Lotus H,V,X means: the number of Horizontal rows, the number of Verticals and the number of rows in between. See the picture at the top of this article. 

### Lotus building
The general Lotus scheme looks like the scheme in the picture. Of course, other scheme's are possible. There are lots of them in the gallery.   
Building bigger lotus is similair to the building of bigger fish, as illustrated on the _Fish_ page.
