### Introduction
Fish grounds are usualy used in small braids. Milanese braids typically need 14-18 pairs of bobbins.     
The grounds consists of a number of rows with two cloth stitches, lets call these rows the _bones_, and the verticals the _spines_, followed with some twists in the weaver. Fish starts and closes with a cloth stitch. In between the fish-rows, zero, one ore more rows with e.g. half stitch, pin, half stitch are made, lets call these the __waves__. The number of these rows defines whether the fish will be in straight vertical lines, or in alternating positions.

Broader fish can be made, e.g. with four cloth stitches. In some Milanese grounds, the heads and tails are made as a cloth stitch with pairs. Groundforge does not support this. Making the head and tail as a half spider is supported. In Groundforge these fish can be obtained using the second or even third level diagram. (example follows) 

### Fish notation
Fish B,S,W means: B (bones): the number vertical cloth stitches, S (spine): the number of intersecting cloth stitch rows,  W (waves): the number of half stitch, pin, half stitch rows. See the picture at the top of this article.

### Braids
Groundforge can do braids, however, you have to feed it with a matrix covering the complete width of the braid, including footsides. This will lead to a considerable amount of ID's to specify in the stitches section. Therefor, the examples provided focus on just the fish. No attention is paid to footsides.

### Fish scheme
The general fish scheme looks like the scheme in the picture (picture). Of course, other scheme's are possible. There are lots of them in the gallery (link).
