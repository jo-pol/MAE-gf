### Squared Rose ground
By putting the traditional rose ground unit in a square, little stars can be made.   
Please note: when making the actual lace, it will make a big difference if the unit in the middle is made torchon-style or flemish-style, as the picture illustrates.

### Squared Snowflake
The little snowflake can also be put into a square. However, we have not been able (yet) to discover the matrix-scheme for the crossed snowflake on the right.

### Squared Spider
See page [Spiders](https://github.com/MAETempels/MAE-gf/wiki/Spiders#spiders-in-a-square).

### Squared pagoda
See page [Pagoda's](https://github.com/MAETempels/MAE-gf/wiki/Pagoda's-or-Triangular-grounds). 
(The [link](https://github.com/MAETempels/MAE-gf/wiki/Pagoda's-or-Triangular-grounds#pagoda-in-a-square) directly to the paragraph does not work correctly.)

### Short Bias
Take just one unit of the Bias ground and place them all in the same direction, or in alternating directions. The latter may give nice results in two colours.

### Plaits and Roses
The traditional rose ground units separated with plaits. Please note: the plaits should stay plaits. The Snowflake example uses the same pricking as the rose ground, but is made as a little snowflake.
