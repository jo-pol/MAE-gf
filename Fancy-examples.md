### Squared rose ground
By putting the traditional rose ground unit in a square, little stars can be made.   
Please note: when making the actual lace, it will make a big difference if the unit in the middle is made torchon-style or flemish-style, as the picture illustrates.

### Squared snowflake
The little snowflake can also be put into a square.

### Plaits and Roses
The traditional rose ground units separated with plaits. Please note: the plaits should stay plaits. The Snowflake example uses the same pricking as the rose ground, but is made as a little snowflake.
